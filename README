This project focuses on predicting the productivity of garment workers using a machine learning approach, based on the Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees dataset.

Project Description:
Preprocessed the data using a combination of StandardScaler for numerical features and OneHotEncoder/OrdinalEncoder for categorical features.
Addressed missing values using a reduced feature pattern method.
Applied Time Series Split to maintain the temporal structure of the data: train, validation, and test sets were divided into sequential time periods.
Trained and evaluated the following machine learning models:
Linear Models: Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression
Non-Linear Models: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Performed hyperparameter tuning for each model to improve performance.
Used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the primary evaluation metric due to its interpretability and robustness against outliers.

Results:
The best-performing model was Random Forest, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.119, slightly better than the baseline (MAE = 0.120).
Feature importance analysis (Permutation Importance, Gain-Based Importance, and SHAP) revealed that:
Top Features: targeted_productivity, smv, and over_time
Least Important Features: is_weekend, team-specific variables (e.g., team_7, team_8)
